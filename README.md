# FuTurister

Futurister is an app developed from scratch as a journal app developed for tourists completely in material design. The app allows to write review of places as well as to share images of the place and also provides review of various tourist destinations. 

## Features

* Write review of tourist places
* Get video review of Tourist places
* Share images of the place
* Material design

## Work with Source code
The app uses `parse` as a realtime database, which is discontinued now, so you'll need to host parse in your own hosting space. Also the app uses Youtube player API, for which you ll also need to generate an API key from Youtube! All other configurations can be edited from `build.gradle` file.
